# Assemblyhook
A simple assembly webhook demonstration
What i learnt:
Registers and Memory, including messing with stack and heap operations.
Syntax for x86-64 architecture (there's a bug on my monitor).
Creating and managing sockets at a low level and TCP/IP communication.
HTTP requests, including headers and body formatting, because that was essential for sending messages to the webhook.
Data declaration and initialization with db for strings and resb for buffers.
Efficient memory use by understanding .data and .bss segments.
String handling, especially managing null-terminated strings for input and output.
